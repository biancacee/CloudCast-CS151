# Cloud Cast

### GROUP MEMBERS RESPONSIBILITY
- Bianca: Assisted in Front-end development using Java FXML and CSS; Back-end development using Java and JSON to access OpenWeatheAPI; documentation
- Travis:  Pulled API data and connected API information to front-end through fxml
- Guadalupe: Implemented user sign-up and login to back-end, UML diagram, and slides
- Alisha: connected data from API to dashboard, project proposal, and slides


### PREVIOUS WORKS

Projects from classes include:
CMPE-131, CMPE-133, CMPE-157A

### ASSUMPTIONS/OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS/USAGE

We will be using JavaFX and Scene Builder to create this weather app. Additionally, we will obtain an existing API such as MetaWeather.  JSON will be used to retrieve weather application information and display it to the users.

With Maven we will need to add necessary dependencies for creating HTTP requests, including libraries such as the Apache HttpComponents library.

### SOLUTION

### PLAN
- Decide which framework and database to use
- API integration with MetaWeather
- Create app architecture and design using SceneBuilder
- Use Agile development process
- Provide testing and quality assurance
- User registration and authentication
- Implementation of an alert system

### APPROACH
- Use JavaFX for GUI
- Integrate public API MetaWeather
- Use JSON to parse responses
- Create an appealing UI to incorporate our project



### FUNCTIONALITY
The functionality of this application relies on the implementation of an API to provide the end user with accurate weather information. This weather information includes, but is not limited to, current weather conditions and predictions of future weather conditions. The information will be presented in several ways including air temperature, humidity, wind, UV index, precipitation expectancy, and additional features that can enhance the user experience. Our goal is to provide accurate weather information for short-term and long-term forecasts. Search filters will give users options to search by city, state, or zipcode. Additionally, allowing users to create an account and save their preferred cities will help them access desired information faster. Users can delete their account but can continue to monitor the weather without saving preferences. Implementing the use of alerts to notify users of an upcoming storm, heatwave, or relevant information will give users the opportunity to prepare for the upcoming weather. We hope to provide users with a reliable and appealing weather source to stay updated and plan accordingly.


### OPERATIONS
End-user:
- Input and Change desired location for weather information using search criteria
- View and access weather information
- Input and view the desired time frame for weather information
- Access short-term, and long-term weather forecasts
- View sunrise and sunset times
- Customize Units and Preferences including degrees in Fahrenheit or Celsius
- View radar/satellite information
- Receive alerts and warnings
- Create an account to save preferred locations
- Delete account 

### PROBLEM TO SOLVE
We hope to provide the best user experience in weather applications using an existing API to provide real-time weather forecasts.Our solution was to build an application that will provide users with the ability to search for cities and return the weather information for the desired location. Users can use the search bar to enter the city name of the location they are interested in. The application uses a reliable API that is used to retrieve weather information for the specified location. Images, temperature, sunset, and sunrise information are some of the features offered through CloudCast.


### STEPS TO RUN APPLICATION
- Must have a valid API key from OpenWeatherAPI version 2.5
- Clone project from GitHub
- Open Project in IDE
- Run the Project to experience CloudCast
